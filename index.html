		<p>For the chart from datawrapper, I wanted to show the upward trend of the graph showing the increase in fatalities from 2013 to 2020. I thought that a column chart was the best way to show this because you can clearly see the increase in the order as you look across the graph. I kept the colors the same because it was easier to see the increase with the colors being the same, rather than them being different and making it harder to tell. I do not think I would change anything of this graph because it gives off the point that I am trying to show simply for the viewer to understand.</p>
		<p>In my creative dataviz, I thought it would be a cool idea to have a map of the United States and sketch out each of the states, and in them write the number of fatalities they each had in the seven year span that this data covers. Once I completed that, the map looked quite boring, so the idea came to me to add a bit of color and show which states had to highest number of fatalities, so coloring in the states that had a higher number than 75 is what I did, and 75 was a good number for this because thats's where there was a gap between the bigger numbers ans the smaller ones, so it seemed like a good place to divide it.Looking at this, I might change how clean it looks to make it easier to understand and read for the viewer.</p>
		<p>Overall, you can see in the upward trend of deaths, and in the creative dataviz you can see that the bigger states with higher populations or big cities had the most fatalities.</p>
